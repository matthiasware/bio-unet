Task
Mitotic count: Number of cells undergoing mitosis
Important parameter for breast cancer detection
Want to detect cells that undergo mitosis

Count = (P + M + A + T) / N 


Data:
	HE Gefärbte Gewebeschnitte in Form von 2084 x 2084 Bilddaten
Task:
	Pixel-level classification!

Questions to prepare
====================
1) What are the advantages and shortcomings of this approach?
	Advantages:
	- Trainable on small dataset
	- U-Architecture reduces parameter count
	- Trained end-to-end
	Shortcommings:
	- memory consuming!
2) Would there be feasible alternatives?
	- Preserving Image size
3) How would you further improve the method?



What I Did Not DO:
- Transposed Convolution
- Image reflection for tiling
- overlap-tile strategy = mirroing to get predictions for the whole regions
- Does Data augmentation help ?
- elastic transformations for augmentation
- 10-fold cross validation
- Hyperparameter tuning

Alternatives:
- classify image as a whole
- old school approaches
- divide image into patches and classify them


architecture:
contraction path:
	repeat:
		2 @ 3x3 convolution, unpadded
		relu
		2x2 max-pooling, stride 2

	double number of feature channels in each step

expansion path:
	repeat:
		upsampling
		2x2 convolution, halves number of feature channels
		concatenation with corresponding cropped features map
		3x3 convolution
		relu
		3x4 convolution
		relu

	last
		1x1 convolution


Training Dataset: The sample of data used to fit the model. (weights and biases)
Validation Dataset: The sample of data used to provide an unbiased evaluation of a model fit on the training dataset while tuning model hyperparameters. The evaluation becomes more biased as skill on the validation dataset is incorporated into the model configuration.
Test Dataset: The sample of data used to provide an unbiased evaluation of a final model fit on the training dataset.
				How well does it generalize?
